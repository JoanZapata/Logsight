#  Logsight

**Logsight** is a macOS application for visualizing **one or multiple structured log files** encoded in **JSON**.

## Rationale 

On most applications, especially on the server side, logging in plain text quickly becomes limited, and we tend to generate structured logs instead, usually using **JSON** as a format. Structured logging is very powerful for debugging but it makes log files not so human-readable:

```json
{"@timestamp":"2019-01-01T15:13:12.762+01:00","@version":"1","message":"Starting WebApplication","logger_name":"com.joanzapata.logger","thread_name":"main","level":"INFO","level_value":20000}
{"@timestamp":"2019-01-01T15:13:12.784+01:00","@version":"1","message":"No active profile set, falling back to default profiles: default","logger_name":"com.joanzapata.logger","thread_name":"main","level":"INFO","level_value":20000}
â€¦
```

Logsight is being developed to aggregate multiple files like that in real time and make them browsable and readable.

## Current state

Logsight is currently in a very early version:
* Handles drag-and-drop of one or multiple files into it;
* Parses JSON content and displays the filename, date, log level and message for each log;
* Adds new logs as soon as they are written in the source files;
* Allows filtering the logs by file and log level.
